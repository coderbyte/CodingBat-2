## [Recursion-1](http://codingbat.com/java)

Basic recursion problems. Recursion strategy: first test for one or two base cases that are so simple, the answer can be returned immediately. Otherwise, make a recursive a call for a smaller case (that is, a case which is a step towards the base case). Assume that the recursive call works correctly, and fix up what it returns to make the answer.
